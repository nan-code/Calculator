/**
 
 An enum is essentially a set of pre-defined variables that won't change.
 We use them to easily reference something multiple times without having to take a lot of computing power
 
 Here I have created an enum that contains the operation types I want you to implement for our calculator.
 You can use these in the calculateTotal function to identify which operation the user requested.
 
 These really are only used as identifiers in this use case, basically a way to keep track of which option
 the user requested. Note, though, that they can be incredibly powerful later one with state machines and such.
